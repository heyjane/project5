# Georgetown Coffee and Yoga

I created this project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program.  This project was inspired by my daughter, Claire, who recently relocated to Georgetown in Washington, D.C.

You can use this interactive map to search for the most popular wi-fi enabled coffeeshops 
and yoga/pilates studios in the Georgetown area:

1.  You can type in a keyword (like yoga, coffee, or pilates) to filter the locations.
2.  You can scroll the optional dropdown navigation list to find a location and click
    on it for more information.  
3.  You can click on a map marker to get more information.

The map markers depict the type of location (yoga or coffee).  When you click on a 
location, the map zooms and recenters to that location.  An information window opens with 
location details as well as a link to the Foursquare page for that site.  If Foursquare tips 
are available, a sample tip is displayed in the window as well. 

The navigation list can be hidden or displayed by clicking on the up/down arrow icon.  For 
smaller screens, the navigation list is hidden by default.

You can reset the map center/zoom by clicking on the RESET MAP button in the lower
right corner.
