# Georgetown Coffee and Yoga

I created this project for my daughter, Claire, who recently relocated to 
Georgetown in Washington, D.C.

You can use this interactive map to search for the most popular wi-fi enabled coffeeshops 
and yoga/pilates studios in the Georgetown area:

1.  You can type in a keyword (like yoga, coffee, or pilates) to filter the locations.
2.  You can scroll the optional dropdown navigation list to find a location and click
    on it for more information.  
3.  You can click on a map marker to get more information.

The map markers depict the type of location (yoga or coffee).  When you click on a 
location, the map zooms and recenters to that location.  An information window opens with 
location details as well as a link to the Foursquare page for that site.  If Foursquare tips 
are available, a sample tip is displayed in the window as well. 

The navigation list can be hidden or displayed by clicking on the up/down arrow icon.  For 
smaller screens, the navigation list is hidden by default.

You can reset the map center/zoom by clicking on the RESET MAP button in the lower
right corner.
